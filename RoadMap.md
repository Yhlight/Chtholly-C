# Chtholly Compiler Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Chtholly compiler.

## Phase 1: Core Compiler Infrastructure

- [ ] **Lexer:** Implement a lexical analyzer to convert Chtholly source code into a stream of tokens.
- [ ] **Parser:** Implement a parser to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream.
- [ ] **Code Generator:** Implement a code generator to traverse the AST and produce C++ code.
- [ ] **Build System:** Set up a CMake build system with a Python build script.

## Phase 2: Basic Language Features

- [ ] **Variables:** Implement `let` and `mut` variable declarations.
- [ ] **Data Types:** Support for basic data types (int, double, char, bool, string).
- [ ] **Operators:** Implement all C++ operators.
- [ ] **Functions:** Implement function definitions and calls.
- [ ] **Control Flow:** Implement `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, and `while` statements.

## Phase 3: Advanced Language Features

- [ ] **Structs:** Implement `struct` definitions and instantiation.
- [ ] **Ownership and Borrowing:** Implement the ownership system with `&` and `&mut`.
- [ ] **Generics:** Implement generic functions and structs.
- [ ] **Traits and Constraints:** Implement `trait` and `impl` with `?` constraints.
- [ ] **Modules:** Implement `import` statements.

## Phase 4: Standard Library

- [ ] **iostream:** Implement basic input/output functions.
- [ ] **filesystem:** Implement file system operations.
- [ ] **operator:** Implement operator overloading.
- [ ] **reflect:** Implement static reflection.
- [ ] **meta:** Implement metaprogramming features.

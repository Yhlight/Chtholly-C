# Chtholly Compiler Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Chtholly compiler.

## Stage 1: Project Setup

- [x] Set up the development environment.
- [x] Create the basic directory structure (`src/`, `include/`).
- [x] Create project and build files (`RoadMap.md`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `build.py`, `main.cpp`).
- [x] Update the `.gitignore` file.

## Stage 2: Lexer

- [x] Implement the lexer to tokenize the Chtholly source code.
- [x] Integrate and test the lexer.

## Stage 3: Parser

- [x] Implement the parser to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- [x] Integrate and test the parser.

## Stage 4: Semantic Analysis

- [x] Implement the semantic analyzer to perform static analysis.
- [x] Integrate and test the semantic analyzer.

## Stage 5: Code Generation (In Progress)

- [ ] Implement the code generator to transpile the AST to C++.
- [ ] Integrate and test the code generator.

## Stage 6: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement support for `if-else` control flow.
- [ ] Implement support for functions.
- [ ] Implement support for structs.
- [ ] Implement support for generics.
- [ ] Implement support for traits and constraints.
- [ ] Implement support for modules.
